<h2 align="center">Welcome!</h2>

Hi there!

I’m Nicolás, and I’m excited to share this repository with you.

I’m currently pursuing a degree in 'Computer Programming' at 'Universidad de San Martín'. Here, you’ll find a collection of my completed projects. I’m continuously working on new ones, so stay tuned for more updates!

<br>

<h2 align="center">Check them out!</h2>

- In the first one, you'll find a project made for 'Sistemas de Procesamiento de Datos', in Assembler x8086. This project was made in groups, due to its length.
    - [Assembler Project](https://github.com/nicocernadas/Assembler-Project.git)
- The second one is a project for 'Laboratorio de computacion II'. It goes on about a program in C, making a stock for a store. It includes client and file management.
